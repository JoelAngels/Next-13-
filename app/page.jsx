        1 The LORD is my shepherd, I lack nothing. 2 He makes me lie down in
        green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, 3 he refreshes my soul.
        He guides me along the right paths for his nameâ€™s sake. 4 Even though I
        walk through the darkest valley,I will fear no evil, for you are with
        me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 5 You prepare a table
        before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my
        cup overflows. 6 Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the
        days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.
